Hello World

This is example post. Need to modify.

Step 6: Customize the Theme

Your new site already looks great, but you will want to tweak it a little before you release it to the public.
Site Configuration

Open up config.toml in a text editor:

baseURL = "https://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My New Hugo Site"
theme = "ananke"
